# PROJECT Time IS Money

A programming initiative for building an experimental program with a one of a kind algorithm called AVC (Automation/Valuation/Currency).

## THE IDEA



The idea is to create an asset that demonstrates exactly where it will peak, when it will crash and how many times it would reach all time high for investors to know exactly when to invest, how long to hold and when to sell with very minimal risk. Using an algorithm that automatically values said asset using time to increase value in increments with bitcoin as the reference currency.


Currently, every asset in the world that can be traded, is valued by either sentiment or market conditions. Where we stare at charts and hope for the best all day.

With the AVC, the asset (Tokenmobiles) would be SELF VALUATED.....something never existing before.



For this to be executed, experienced programmers are needed to build their version of the program. (At least 100 versions are needed for a secure and sustainable launch)

Once started on IGNITION DAY, the program must run/tick without interruption for over 200 years and CAN NEVER BE STOPPED.

The program must be like world time itself, multiple versions running on various servers, various devices, All following the same pattern/algorithm.




Before programmers begin building their version of the program with their choice of tools, they'll need the fundamental features/details of the asset and AVC algorithm.

## THE ASSET

100 standard cookie cutter fungible token smart contracts were deployed on the Stacks blockchain. 

Each smart contract has 1 unique Tokenmobile with a supply ranging from 200 to 50000. 

There are 999,999 Tokenmobiles all together.

Each unique Tokenmobile has attributes/metadata which is essential for the AVC algorithm.

TYPE - The tag/name of the tokenmobile in morse

SUPPLY - The 1 token out of the fixed supply in the smart contract.

CYCLES - The amount of times the Tokenmobile will crash/restart in value and rebound again

BOOST - The % increase in the Tokenmobile's cycle span everytime it restarts. This increasing it's peak in value.

START - The first cycle duration

MAX - The last cycle duration

AVC - The algorithm/engine that values each Tokenmobile.

## THE ALGORITHM
• A for Automation. The Automation being TIME and TIME being 60 seconds.

• V for Valuation. The Valuation being either in 0.00001 or 0.00003 increments

• C for Currency. The Currency being ₿itcoin used as reference to value Tokenmobiles

So a Tokenmobile would increase by ₿0.00001 or ₿0.00003 every 60 seconds.

## THE PROGRAM

![](/media/program.jpg)


Here is a demo of the program running the AVC algorithm. [WATCH DEMO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10M1PcLHT_r6kEz8bumL3yzdjFDoLvsWI/view?usp=drivesdk)

You are looking at 2 RACKS of 2 Tokenmobiles being valuated by AVC. (official program to have 100 RACKS)

1. Is the smart contract address/location of the asset being valuated.

2. Is the live countup formated in YY/DDD/HH/MM/SS (note that DAYS are to 365) No leap years, No weeks. No months. No milliseconds.

3. Is the timestamp of when the current cycle will end/when the countup will stop to restart. (cycle timestamps for each Tokenmobile provided in FUNDIMENTALS file)

4. Is the total CYCLES which decreases everytime the countup resets and timestamp updates. (note that the first cycle must decrease immediately when the AVC for a Tokenmobile starts. And not after it ends)

5. Is the BOOST.
6. Is the SUPPLY.

(boost and supply are just for display in the UI. No actions in code.)

7. Is the AVC/Value of the Tokenmobile which will increase in either ₿0.00001 or ₿0.00003 increments everytime the countup ticks 60 seconds. The value resets to ₿0.00000 when a new cycle starts. (Note that at the end of the final cycle, the value must stop and stay at its maximum valuation.


The official program ready for IGNITION DAY must have 100 RACKS of each of the 100 Tokenmobile smart contracts all started together and running/ticking on AVC simultaneously until each one ends it's valuation journey. Tokenmobiles-100 will be the first to end after just 60 days at maximum valuation of ₿0.86400 and Tokenmobiles-43 the last to end after over 200 years at maximum valuation of ₿338.93753


The program also reqiures a backend server-side infrastruture, frontend interface to display real time second by second updates with no delay and a hosting solution capable of ensuring 99.99% uptime for over 200 years.

## THE CODE

There is no template or open source code for the program/AVC to begin with. And the demo was coded just to run in terminal as visual demonstration. It is expected that each programmer codes their version of the program from complete scratch using their choice of tools, their own server, hosting solution and the fundimentals provided to them. 


The reason for this, is to avoid duplicate versions with possibly the same bugs in code. There must be different code of the same program. This sustaining the longevity and security of the program.

## THE ENVIRONMENT

The Time IS Money initiative will be active on GitHub and Discord where programmers can come together to discuss and update on their process of attempting to build the program. 

Once programmers actively build and share test runs of the program, they will recieve the IGNITION DAY date to officially run the program live and a package of the asset the program valuates. (10 years 1st cycle's worth of Tokenmobiles)

## THE ACCOMPLISHMENT

If more than 100 versions of the program goes live on IGNITION DAY weather public or private, The asset and program would instantly have locked in significance and importance. Compared to stocks, metals, crypto, ETFs etc, it would be the only self valuated asset in the world.
